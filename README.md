[ ] Short text description of what your project does. (Don’t just say “option 1”. Tell us what your project does.)
  I decided to follow guidelines for option 1. My project caches data from NYT and the Guardian. The data consists of search results from query "mental health".
  I created a class which gives the authors, titles, url, if they exist. Then, I made a csv in a readable, easy format for humans.




[ ] Brief explanation of what the result of your project should be if it ran correctly
Once the program runs, in the same directory you should find a CSV file called `articles.csv`, which should have six columns, containing info about the title, author, section, number of words in title, what site it was published on and its url
